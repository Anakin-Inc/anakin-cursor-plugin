# Anakin CLI setup

1. Before running any `anakin` command, verify the CLI is installed and authenticated by running `anakin status`.
2. If anakin-cli is not installed, install it with `pip install anakin-cli`.
3. If not authenticated, run `anakin login --api-key "<key>"` or prompt the user for their API key from anakin.io/dashboard.
4. Never hardcode or log API keys in files — use `anakin login` to store credentials securely.
